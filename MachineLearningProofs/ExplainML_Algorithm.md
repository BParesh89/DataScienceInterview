1. Explain a machine learning algorithm in layman's terms.This is more challenging than most realize. I'm looking for an intuitive understanding of machine learning algorithms and clear communication skills here. Pretty much everybody picks random forest.
2. "What is the most complex mathematical theorem proof in Data Mining that you can write now for us on these papers?".
3. Explain Bayes Theorem in layman's terms
4. Name and explain 3 different dimensionality reduction strategies
5. Explain boostrapping and its practical uses in machine learning
6. Different types of clustering and how the algorithms work (hierarchical and KMEANS). 
7. You have two machine learning algorithms that have the same accuracy. How can you determine which is better. 
<br> Expectation: ROC curves. 
8.
