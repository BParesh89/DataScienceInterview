# Stats for Now
Going to move to Jupyter and RMarkdown as it can have Latex better than markdown. It will have some limitation, but better than nothing. Might make a bunch of links to other references for this. 

## Need to Know
1. Orthogonal: dot product is zero. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality
2. 


## Good to Know
1. Orthonormal Matrix: orthogonal and unit vectors.
```
# Latex in case you want to add to Jupyter Later

$ \vec{e}_i \cdot  \vec{e}_j = 0$ when $j \ne i$ and $ \vec{e}_i \cdot  \vec{e}_j = 1$ when $j = i$
```

## More Advanced (not important, but will move to other section later). 
1. unitary:  complex square matrix U is unitary if its conjugate transpose U' is also its inverseâ€”that is, if U'U = UU'=I. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix
