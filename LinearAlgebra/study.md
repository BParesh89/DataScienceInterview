# Latex in case you want to add to Jupyter Later

$ \vec{e}_i \cdot  \vec{e}_j = 0$ when $j \ne i$ and $ \vec{e}_i \cdot  \vec{e}_j = 1$ when $j = i$

## More Advanced (not important, but will move to other section later). 
1. unitary:  complex square matrix U is unitary if its conjugate transpose U' is also its inverseâ€”that is, if U'U = UU'=I. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix
