1. How would you approach a categorical feature with high-cardinality?
2. How would you deal with sparsity?
3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using regularization methods like Ridge Regression?
4. What are the problems of large feature space? How does it affect different models, e.g. OLS? What about computational complexity?
5. What is Lasso regression? How is it different from OLS and Ridge?
6. What is Regularization?
7. What is Ridge Regression? How is it different from OLS Regression? Why do we need it?
8. What is the difference between density-sparse data and dimensionally-sparse data?
9. What Is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization methods?
10. When might you want to use ridge regression instead of traditional linear regression?
11. Which problem does Regularization try to solve?
12. Why (geometrically) does LASSO produce solutions with zero-valued coefficients (as opposed to ridge)?
