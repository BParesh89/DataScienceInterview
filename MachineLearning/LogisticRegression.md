1. I know that a linear regression model is generally evaluated using Adjusted R² or F value. How would you evaluate a logistic regression model?
2. How can you assess a good logistic model?
3. How would you train a logistic regression model?
4. What is the effect on the coefficients of logistic regression if two predictors are highly correlated? What are the confidence intervals of the coefficients?
5. What relationships exist between a logistic regression’s coefficient and the Odds Ratio?
