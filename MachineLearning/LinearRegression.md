1. Why is R2 horrible for determining the quality of a model and name at least two better metrics. 
2. Why is linear regression called linear?
3. What are the assumptions that standard linear regression models with standard estimation techniques make? How can some of these assumptions be relaxed?
4. What Is the following parts of a linear regression to me p-value, coefficient, R-Squared value. What is the significance of each of these components and what assumptions do we hold when creating a linear regression?
5. Could you explain some of the extension of linear models like Splines or LOESS/LOWESS?
6. Do you consider the models Y~X1+X2+X1X2 and Y~X1+X2+X1X2 to be linear? Why?
7. In linear regression, under what condition R^2 always equals a perfect 1?
8. What are the basic assumptions to be made for linear regression?
9. What are the constraints you need to keep in mind when using a linear regression?
10. What is heteroskedasticity and how to solve it
11. What is the difference between logistic and linear regression? How do you avoid local minima?
